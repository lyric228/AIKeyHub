Hello everyone, many of you probably know that using a search on github you can find free working api keys from various services, for example, api keys from OpenAI, deepseek, etc., and I managed to make a couple of working filters for searching on github to find a lot of working keys, I certainly do not promise that everything will be fine. it works 100%, but you can try it if you want.

# [Gemini](https://github.com/search?q=%22AIzaSy%22+AND+%28gemini+OR+%22generativelanguage.googleapis.com%22%29+AND+path%3Asrc+AND+%28path%3A*.env+OR+path%3A*.json+OR+path%3A*.yaml+OR+path%3A*.yml+OR+path%3A*.txt+OR+path%3A.env+OR+path%3Aconfig%29&type=code)
```
"AIzaSy" AND (gemini OR "generativelanguage.googleapis.com") AND path:src AND (path:*.env OR path:*.json OR path:*.yaml OR path:*.yml OR path:*.txt OR path:.env OR path:config)
```
