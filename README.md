Hello everyone, many of you probably know that using a search on github, you can find free working api keys from various services, for example, api keys from OpenAI, deepseek, etc., and I managed to make a couple of working filters for searching on github to find a lot of working keys, I certainly do not promise that everything will be fine. it works 100%, but you can try it if you want.
Also, while writing filters for search, I noticed that, for example, it is almost impossible to write a good filter for Mistral, since their keys seem to be completely random, so I don't have any ideas how to make filters for them yet, sorry.nt.
